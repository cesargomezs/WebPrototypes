        This warehouse is dedicated to the storage, organization, and
        distribution of clothing for both babies and adults. It holds a wide
        variety of garments, including everyday wear, seasonal apparel, and
        special collections. Items are carefully categorized by size, age group,
        gender, and type of clothingâ€”such as onesies, dresses, pants, jackets,
        and accessories. The facility is equipped with shelving units, hanging
        racks, and climate control systems to preserve fabric quality. Incoming
        shipments are received and checked for quality, then stored until ready
        for packaging and delivery to retail stores, online customers, or
        distribution centers. Efficient inventory systems ensure fast order
        fulfillment and accurate stock management across multiple clothing
        lines.
